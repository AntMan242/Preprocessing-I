    <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>I have outwitted the greatest detective known to man [Batman]. I have been causing chaos in the city of Gotham since the 40's. I have destroyed families, I have lied, and I've stole, and I've cheated my way to prosperity. I revolutionized what it has meant to be a "villain". I have been known to work in team environments to get the job done, even though team dynamics is not my strong point. I have shown that i will do whatever it takes to get the job done.</p>

    <h2 class="work">Work History</h2>
      <h3 class="workH">The Killing Joke, May/1988</h3>
        <p class="wrk">After a failed career as a comedian, I began my life of crime as the masked villain Red Hood, which led to me falling into a liquid of chemicals which bleached my skin, and turned my hair green. I took my criminal activity to a new level and shot and paralyzed the one they call Batgirl. I also kidnapped and torchered Gotham's police commisioner James Gordon.</p>
      <h3 class="workH">A Death in the Family, November/1988</h3>
        <p class="wrk">I escaped from Arkham Asylum prison, kidnapped a Doctor who's son was the new Robin, beat him with a crowbar and tied him up next to his mother inside of a warehouse, and blew up the warehouse like it was the 4th of July. Ask batman if they survived [hehe]. This was some of my best work because it devastated ol Bats.</p>
      <h3 class="workH">The Joker's Last Laugh, October/2001</h3>
        <p class="wrk" >I found out I was going to die of a brain tumor and i needed some very fulfilling work before I was no more. I used a venomt to "jokerize" all the inmates at Slab Penitentiary. The venom bleached their skin and turned their hair green, and they looked just like me. I started a legendary riot at Slab Penitentiary, which prompted President Luthor to declare war on little ol me. As with most of my work, the casualty count was high, which brought a huge smile to my face.</p>
